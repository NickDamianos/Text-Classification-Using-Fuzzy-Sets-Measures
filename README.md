A very important task of Natural Language Processing is text categorization (or text
classification), which aims to automatically classify a document into categories. This kind of task
includes numerous applications, such as sentiment analysis, language or intent detection, heavily
used by social-/brand-monitoring tools, customer service, and the voice of customer, among others.
Since the introduction of Fuzzy Set theory, its application has been tested in many fields, from
bioinformatics to industrial and commercial use, as well as in cases with vague, incomplete, or
imprecise data, highlighting its importance and usefulness in the fields. The most important aspect of
the application of Fuzzy Set theory is the measures employed to calculate how similar or dissimilar
two samples in a dataset are. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 43 similarity and 19
distance measures in the task of text document classification, using the widely used BBC News
and BBC Sports benchmark datasets. Their performance is optimized through hyperparameter
optimization techniques and evaluated via a leave-one-out cross-validation technique, presenting
their performance using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
